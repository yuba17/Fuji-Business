# Tech Stack Rules

- The backend must always be built using Laravel (PHP).
- Filament is the primary UI/admin framework for all internal dashboards, panels, and admin-facing interfaces.
- MySQL is the only database engine allowed for persistence.
- The frontend (outside of Filament) must be built using Blade templates with Livewire and Alpine.js for interactivity.
- TailwindCSS is the only styling system allowed (no custom CSS frameworks unless explicitly approved).
- Vite is the required build tool for all frontend assets (development uses `npm run dev`, production uses `npm run build`).
- No external frontend frameworks such as React or Vue may be introduced unless explicitly approved.
- No alternative backend runtimes (such as Node.js, Python, or Go) may be introduced.
